# Usage:
The **wine32-deploy** Commands

> Note: All commands must receive a bottle name


| Command         |    | What its does                                   |
|-----------------|----|-------------------------------------------------|
| create-bottle   | => | Create a new bottle with default settings       |
| install         | => | Install a software from outside bottle          |
| run             | => | Run a software already on the bottle            |
| --strip         | => | Remove unnecessary resources                    |
| package         | => | Package the bottle as AppImage                  |

Usage per command:

* create-bottle:
```
create-bottle  "Bottle Name"
```
The "Bottle Name" is also "App Name"

* install:
```
install  "Bottle Name" "path/to/file.exe"
```
The "path/to/file.exe" is relative to the current directory, and does not need to be inside  "bottle"

* --strip:
```
--strip  "Bottle Name" resource
```
"resource" can be any of these things:

```
 
  mesa3D   -->  Support for DirectX 8 apps
  windows  -->  Wine hardcoded libs (not recommended in most cases)
  gecko    -->  Trident open source replacement (needed by applications that displays HTML content)
  mono     -->  Open source replacement for .NET Framework (with Windows Forms)
  
```

* run:
```
run  "Bottle Name" "C:\path\to\file.exe"
```
The "C:/path/to/file.exe" must be absolute and you don't need worry about slashes be "\\" or "/" but make sure that starts with "C:" and file exists on "Bottle Name/prefix/drive_c/"

* package:
```
package  "Bottle Name" "C:\path\to\file.exe" "Category" "path/to/icon.png"
```
The "C:/path/to/file.exe" is the main executable of your program and must be absolute and you don't need worry about slashes be "\" or "/" but make sure that starts with "C:" and file exists on "Bottle Name/prefix/drive_c/"

"Category" represents basically what your application does, the valid words is:

```
 
    AudioVideo     Audio        Video    Development    Education    Game
    Graphics       Network      Office   Science        Settings     System
    Utility
 
```
At last "path/to/icon.png" is the icon of your program, the path is relative to current directory, and does not need to be inside  "bottle", but mustbe in PNG format with a recommended 256x256px resolution
