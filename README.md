# Usage:
The **wine32-deploy** Commands

### Bottle usage commands:

| Command         |    | What its does                                   |
|-----------------|----|-------------------------------------------------|
| create-bottle   | => | Create a new bottle with default settings       |
| install         | => | Install a software from outside bottle          |
| run             | => | Run the bottle as AppImage                      |

* create-bottle:
```
create-bottle  "Bottle Name"
```

* install:
```
install  "Bottle Name" "path/to/file.exe"
```
The "path/to/file.exe" is relative to the current directory, and does not need to be inside  "bottle"

* run:
```
run  "Bottle Name"
```
You must set a "main executable" first

### Bottle modification commands:

| Command               |    | What its does                       |
|-----------------------|----|-------------------------------------|
| set-main-executable   | => | Set main executable of bottle       |
| set-name              | => | Set name for application menu name  |
| set-icon              | => | Set icon for AppImage               |
| set-category          | => | Defines where application will appear on menu               |

* set-main-executable:
```
set-main-executable "Bottle Name" "C:\path\to\file.exe"
```
The "C:/path/to/file.exe" is the main executable of your program, and follow some rules:
1. Must be absolute
2. You don't need worry about slashes be "\" or "/" 
3. Make sure that parameter starts with "C:" and file exists on "Bottle Name/prefix/drive_c/"

* set-name:
```
set-name "Bottle Name" "New App Name"
```

* set-icon:
```
set-icon "Bottle Name" "path/to/icon.png"
```
"path/to/icon.png" is the icon of your program, the path is relative to current directory, and does not need to be inside  "bottle", but must be in PNG format with a recommended 256x256px resolution

* set-category:
```
set-category "Bottle Name" "Category"
```
"Category" is the category of your program, in Linux this will determine where your Application will appear on Menu

|--------------|----|------------------------|
| enable       | => | Enable a flag          |
| disable      | => | Set icon for AppImage  |
| list-flags   | => | List available flags   |

Flags modify behavior of packaged apps

* enable:
```
enable "Bottle Name" copy-app-files
```

Enable flag "copy-app-files"

* disable:
```
disable "Bottle Name" copy-app-files
```

Disable flag "copy-app-files"

* list-flags:
```
list-flags
```
List supported flags and what they do

### AppDir creation and manipulation commands:

| Command       |    | What its does                           |
|---------------|----|-----------------------------------------|
| create-appdir | => | Create an AppDir from bottle            |
| minimize      | => | Remove uneeded files from bottle        |
| test          | => | Test a bottle as AppImage               |
| package       | => | Build a AppImage from the bottle AppDir |

Flags modify behavior of packaged apps

* create-appdir:
```
create-appdir "Bottle Name"
```
If application does verification of DLL sigatures you must pass `--keep-registry` parameter

* minimize:
```
minimize "Bottle Name"
```
This command allows the quick removal of unnecessary Wine files for the application to run

* test:
```
test "Bottle Name"
```
This command allows test application simulating a real user HOME, before packaging AppImage

* package:
```
package "Bottle Name"
```
Simplified way to build an AppImage from the bottle

# Building AppImage from source
All you need is the `docker` and `git`, most linux distributions have it in the repository, once time installed, you need 5 steps:

1. Clone repository and enter on repository (if you don't did it):
```
git clone https://github.com/sudo-give-me-coffee/wine32-deploy.git
cd wine32-deploy
```
2. Turn the build script executable:
```
chmod +x build.sh
```
3. Run docker:
```
docker build . -t wine.appimage
```
4. Copy AppImage to current dir and remove original file:
```
sudo cp "$(sudo find /var/lib/docker -name 'Wine-*x86_64.AppImage')" .
sudo rm "$(sudo find /var/lib/docker -name 'Wine-*x86_64.AppImage')" .
```
4. Make AppImage executable:
```
sudo chmod 777 Wine-*x86_64.AppImage
```
